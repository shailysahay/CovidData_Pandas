# Clean and Format India's Covid-19 data

India's state and district wise Covid-19 data is pulled from the website:

https://api.covid19india.org/state_district_wise.json

Although the data is in JSON, the format is not proper to be converted to a Pandas dataframe.    
In this project, data is cleaned and converted to a format which can be used to create a Pandas DataFrame.
